## Game Explanation

This year's competition is titled VEX: Over-Under

The field will be divided horizontally into two halves, however, during the match there are two alliance offensive zones corresponding to the color of the alliance goal. There are two goals each being assigned one alliance color, as well as four match loading zones, two being assigned to each alliance color. There are 2 elevation structures each corresponging with a color to indicate alliance use. Teams will be tasked with scoring triballs from the field, as well as the alliance match loading zone. Triballs are scored in your alliance goal for 5 points each. They can also be scored by remaining in your alliance's offensive zone at the end of the match for 2 points each. There are 2 red and 2 blue triballs each corresponding to an alliance, they can be scored in any alliance goal or zone. In the last 30 seconds of the match robots will be allowed to elevate off the ground while remaining in contact with their alliance elevation structure. Elevation points are given based on elevation height, as well as opposing teams elevation height.

The match will start with a 15-second autonomous period followed by a driver controlled period lasting a minute and 45 seconds. All game rules are in effect during both the autonomous period and the driver controlled period, though manually driving the bot using the controller is not allowed during the autonomous period. Each alliance is given 2 colored triballs corresponding to their alliance color.

 The robots starting possision at the start of the match has to be within 18"x18"x18". At the beginning of the match robots are allowed to expand up to 36" horizontally. During the match, each robot is only able to be in possession of 1 triball at a time.

 Robots may only be constructed with up to 8 V5 motors as well as 2 pneumatic reservoirs, each capped at 100 Psi. The use of non-VEX parts are legal as long as they are deemed non functional decoration by a judge. No external tampering with any electronic devices is allowed.

 ## Scoring

|Scoring Objective| Points Rewarded |
|:---: | :--: |
|Triballs Under Goal| 5 Points|
|Triballs In Alliance Zone| 2 Points|
|Maximum Elevation| 20 Points|
|Minimum Elevation| 5 Points|
|Winner of Autonomous Bonus| 8 Points|

## Field Elements
In Over-Under there are 5 unique field elements consisting of the Alliance Goals, Match Loading Bars, Elevation Structures, Middle Barrier, and Triballs. 

### Alliance Goals
The Alliance Goals can be found on opposite sides of the field and sit on bars attached to the outer walls of the perimeter. There is a net that connects to the front goal support and rests on the back perimeter, creating an angle. The goals can be found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance scores in each Goal.

Each Alliance Goal is 47.13" wide, 23.08" long, and 5.78" tall. The front of the net is raised to 5.78" and the back of the net sits at 11.5", creating a 14.27° angle. 

The Goal refers specifically to the three-dimensional volume bounded by a vertical projection of the outermost PVC pipes onto the field and below the surface of the net.

### Match Loading Bars
There is a Match Loading Bar in each of the four courners of the field specified by Allince Color. 

The Match Loading Bars are 30" in length and 2.38" in diameter.

There is a vertical plane that starts at the front of the Match Loading Bar. This plane is used to dignify whether or not a robot is able to matchload. A robot has to be crossing the plane of the matchload zone in order for matchloading into the robot to occur.

### Elevation Structures
There are 2 Elevation Structures found at both ends of the Middle Barrier and they attatch to the perimeter of the field. The structures can be found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance can use each structure. 

The Elevation Bar is 11.63" off the ground as well as 21.89" in length. The Elevation Pole is 30.23" tall. Both the Elevation Bar and Pole are 2.38" in diameter.

These structures allow teams to gain up to 20 points for the highest hang. There is an Elevation Measurement stick that is used to determine what Elevation Tier the robots are at. Some teams won't have the mechanics needed to hang, giving the teams that do an advantage. 

### Middle Barrier
There is a barrier located at the center of the field seperating the field into two sides. Each team at any time is allowed to traverse over the Middle Barrier to get to the other side. 

The Middle Barrier is 91.88" in length and 2.38" in diameter. The barrier is raised 0.50" off the ground and 2.88" at its highest point.

During the match, if 2 robots from the same alliance are on the same side of the Middle Barrier it is considered Double-Zoning. If Double-Zoning occurs, the opposing alliance is allowed to de-score from the opposite's Alliance Goal. 

### Triballs
The field is set up with 12 neutral Triballs that are placed in the same position at the beginning of each match. During the match, each alliance has 22 neutral Triballs that can be matchload into the Match Load Zones or gently matchload onto their robot that is contacting the Match Load Zone. The Triballs can be found in the green neutral color, or  red or blue designating each alliance. 

The Triballs are a slightly rounded triangluar pyramidal shape also refered to as a Reuleaux Triangle. Each Triball is 6.18" tall and weigh approximately 110 grams.

During the match, robots can move Triballs into either their alliance's Goal, or in their alliance's offensive zone. Each robot is only able to be in possession of 1 triball at a time.


## Dated Entries

### 11/27/23

Rhett tried to fix seg fault issues in code as well as learning how to program individually addressable neopixels
Elliott exported the 3d face image of the custom polycarbonate extending wings. This custom polycarbonate was created in our current robot’s CAD file in inventor, to fit the specifications of our robot. The 3d face image was imported into a laser cutter which cut the polycarbonate into the right shape. After the laser cutter finished cutting the wings we were able to attach them successfully as well as test them.
