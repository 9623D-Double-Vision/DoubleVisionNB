## Game Explanation

This year's competition is titled VEX: Over-Under

The field will be divided horizontally into two halves, however, during the match there are two Alliance Offensive Zones corresponding to the color of the Alliance Goal. There are two goals each being assigned one alliance color, as well as four Match Loading Zones, two being assigned to each alliance color. There are 2 elevation structures each corresponging with a color to indicate alliance use. Teams will be tasked with scoring triballs from the field, as well as the alliance match loading zone. Triballs are scored in your alliance goal for 5 points each. They can also be scored by remaining in your alliance's offensive zone at the end of the match for 2 points each. There are 2 red and 2 blue triballs each corresponding to an alliance, they can be scored in any alliance goal or zone. In the last 30 seconds of the match, robots will be allowed to elevate off the ground while remaining in contact with their alliance elevation structure. Elevation points are given based on elevation height, as well as opposing teams elevation height.

The match will start with a 15-second autonomous period followed by a driver controlled period lasting a minute and 45 seconds. All game rules are in effect during both the autonomous period and the driver controlled period, though manually driving the bot using the controller is not allowed during the autonomous period. Each alliance is given 2 colored triballs corresponding to their alliance color.

 The robots starting possision at the start of the match has to be within 18"x18"x18". At the beginning of the match robots are allowed to expand up to 36" horizontally. During the match, each robot is only able to be in possession of 1 triball at a time.

 Robots may only be constructed with up to 8 V5 motors as well as 2 pneumatic reservoirs, each capped at 100 Psi. The use of non-VEX parts are legal as long as they are deemed non functional decoration by a judge. No external tampering with any electronic devices is allowed.

 ## Scoring

## Field Elements
In Over-Under there are 5 unique field elements consisting of the Alliance Goals, Match Loading Bars, Elevation Structures, Middle Barrier, and Triballs. 

### Alliance Goals
The Alliance Goals can be found on opposite sides of the field and sit on bars attached to the outer walls of the perimeter. There is a net that connects to the front goal support and rests on the back perimeter, creating an angle. The goals can be found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance scores in each Goal. 
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/7.png) 

Each Alliance Goal is 47.13" wide, 23.08" long, and 5.78" tall. The front of the net is raised to 5.78" and the back of the net sits at 11.5", creating a 14.27Â° angle. 

The Goal refers specifically to the three-dimensional volume bounded by a vertical projection of the outermost PVC pipes onto the field and below the surface of the net.

### Match Loading Bars
There is a Match Loading Bar in each of the four courners of the field specified by Alliance Color. 

The Match Loading Bars are 30" in length and 2.38" in diameter.

There is a vertical plane that starts at the front of the Match Loading Bar. This plane is used to dignify whether or not a robot is able to matchload. A robot has to be crossing the plane of the matchload zone in order for matchloading into the robot to occur.

### Elevation Structures
There are 2 Elevation Structures found at both ends of the Middle Barrier and they attatch to the perimeter of the field. The structures can be found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance can use each structure. 

The Elevation Bar is 11.63" off the ground as well as 21.89" in length. The Elevation Pole is 30.23" tall. Both the Elevation Bar and Pole are 2.38" in diameter.

These structures allow teams to gain up to 20 points for the highest hang. There is an Elevation Measurement Stick that is used to determine what Elevation Tier the robots are at. Some teams won't have the mechanics needed to hang, giving the teams that do an advantage. 

### Middle Barrier
There is a barrier located at the center of the field seperating the field into two sides. Each team at any time is allowed to traverse over the Middle Barrier to get to the other side. 

The Middle Barrier is 91.88" in length and 2.38" in diameter. The barrier is raised 0.50" off the ground and 2.88" at its highest point. 
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/9.png) 

During the match, if 2 robots from the same alliance are on the same side of the Middle Barrier it is considered Double-Zoning. If Double-Zoning occurs, the opposing alliance is allowed to de-score from the opposite's Alliance Goal. 

### Triballs
The field is set up with 12 neutral Triballs that are placed in the same position at the beginning of each match. During the match, each alliance has 22 neutral Triballs that can be matchload into the Match Load Zones or gently matchloaded onto their robot that is contacting the Match Load Zone. The Triballs can be found in the green neutral color, or  red or blue designating each alliance. 

The Triballs are a slightly rounded triangluar pyramidal shape also refered to as a Reuleaux Triangle. Each Triball is 6.18" tall and weigh approximately 110 grams. 
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/6.png) 

During the match, robots can move Triballs into either their alliance's Goal, or in their alliance's offensive zone to score points. Each robot is only able to be in possession of 1 triball at a time.

## Dated Entries

### 4/29/23 - VRC Game Reveal 2023
*This entry was not a formal practice.*

On the last day of worlds, the 2023-2024 VRC Competition was revealed. Elliott attended worlds with his former team. After the game reveal, Elliott started to brainstorm potential mechanisms for Over-Under. He came across a FRC game similar to OU called Charge-Up. He found FRC team 2910's robot that completed the same function of picking up Reuleaux polygons similar to OU Triballs. The video he saw of the robot is listed below.
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE]()

FRC team 2910's robot had a standard tank drivetrain with an arm, as well as an intake that uses rubber rollers similar to VRC Flex Wheels. The function of the arm and intake was meant to grab the scoring objects off the ground and extend the arm out to place them on a platform. This is very similar to how the VEX Over-Under game is played. 

TLDR: Elliott started bainrstorming ideas for Over-Under mechanisms

### 4/30/23 - Initial Design

After analysing FRC team 2910's robot Elliott started 3D Modeling a bot modified for the Over-Under competition. This design included; a 6 motor drivetrain with a gear ratio of 36:60,catapult which included a slip gear mechanism made from highstrength axles and rubber bands, and an intake utilizing chain drives and flexwheels in order to grip onto the triballs.

### 5/1/23
Elliott researched a way to transport and hold the triballs, he found a claw that uses a chain and sprocket mechanism thats connected to shafts with flex wheels on them to be able to intake the triballs  faster aswell as have a better grip so the robot can hold the triballs more effectively when at highspeeds or taking sharp turns that when using a normal claw would cause the triball to fling escape the contorl of the robot. 

### 5/2/23 
Elliott tried to figure out different possitons and places to place the claw on the robot and allow it to adjust its height but still have it be stable, eventually he decided to add it to the front of the robot using two support beams made up of 25x2x1 C channels attatched on two more supports made up of 18x2x1 C channels. It was motorized via a gear mechanism with a gear ratio of 1:7 using a 12T gear and 84T gear.

### 5/4/23
Elliott started cadding a new drive train which includes lifted wheels due to the old drive train was unable to traverse the middle bar so with the added height it allows the robot to access the other side of the field without having to go through the neutral zone. saving time during the match.

### 11/27/23 - 
Rhett tried to fix seg fault issues in code as well as learning how to program individually addressable neopixels
Elliott exported the 3d face image of the custom polycarbonate extending wings. This custom polycarbonate was created in our current robotâs CAD file in inventor, to fit the specifications of our robot. The 3d face image was imported into a laser cutter which cut the polycarbonate into the right shape. After the laser cutter finished cutting the wings we were able to attach them successfully as well as test them.
