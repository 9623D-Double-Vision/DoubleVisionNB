# Game Explanation

This year's competition is titled VEX: Over-Under

The field will be divided horizontally into two halves; however, during the match, there are two Alliance Offensive Zones corresponding to the color of the Alliance Goal. There are two goals each being assigned one alliance color, as well as four Match Loading Zones, two being assigned to each alliance color. There are 2 elevation structures, each corresponding with a color to indicate alliance use. Teams will be tasked with scoring triballs from the field and the alliance match loading zone. Triballs are scored in your alliance goal for 5 points each. They can also be scored by remaining in your alliance's offensive zone at the end of the match for 2 points each. There are 2 red and 2 blue triballs each corresponding to an alliance, they can be scored in any alliance goal or zone. In the last 30 seconds of the match, robots will be allowed to elevate off the ground while remaining in contact with their alliance elevation structure. Elevation points are given based on elevation height and opposing teams' elevation height.

The match will start with a 15-second autonomous period followed by a driver-controlled period lasting a minute and 45 seconds. All game rules are in effect during both the autonomous period and the driver-controlled period, though manually driving the bot using the controller is not allowed during the autonomous period. Each alliance is given 2 colored triballs corresponding to their alliance color.

 The robots' starting possession at the start of the match has to be within 18"x 18 " x 18". At the beginning of the match, robots are allowed to expand up to 36" horizontally. During the match, each robot is only able to have 1 triball at a time.

 Robots may only be constructed with up to 8 V5 motors as well as 2 pneumatic reservoirs, each capped at 100 Psi. Using non-VEX parts is legal as long as they are deemed nonfunctional decoration by a judge. No external tampering with any electronic devices is allowed.

 ## Scoring

|Scoring Objective| Points Rewarded |
|:---: | :--: |
|Triballs Under Goal| 5 Points|
|Triballs In Alliance Zone| 2 Points|
|Maximum Elevation| 20 Points|
|Minimum Elevation| 5 Points|
|Winner of Autonomous Bonus| 8 Points|

## Field Elements
In Over-Under, there are 5 unique field elements: the Alliance Goals, Match Loading Bars, Elevation Structures, Middle Barrier, and Triballs. 

### Alliance Goals
The Alliance Goals can be found on opposite sides of the field and sit on bars attached to the outer walls of the perimeter. There is a net that connects to the front goal support and rests on the back perimeter, creating an angle. The goals can be found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance scores in each Goal. 
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/7.png) 

Each Alliance Goal is 47.13" wide, 23.08" long, and 5.78" tall. The front of the net is raised to 5.78" and the back of the net sits at 11.5", creating a 14.27Â° angle. 

The Goal refers specifically to the three-dimensional volume bounded by a vertical projection of the outermost PVC pipes onto the field and below the surface of the net.
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/Goal-Dimensions.png) 

### Match Loading Bars
There is a Match Loading Bar in each of the four corners of the field specified by Alliance Color. 

The Match Loading Bars are 30" in length and 2.38" in diameter. 
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/11.png)

There is a vertical plane that starts at the front of the Match Loading Bar. This plane is used to dignify whether or not a robot is able to matchload. A robot has to be crossing the plane of the match load zone in order for match loading into the robot to occur.

### Elevation Structures
Two elevation Structures are found at both ends of the Middle Barrier and attach to the perimeter of the field. The structures are red and blue to designate which alliance can use each one. 

The Elevation Bar is 11.63" off the ground as well as 21.89" in length. The Elevation Pole is 30.23" tall. Both the Elevation Bar and Pole are 2.38" in diameter.
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/10.png) 

These structures allow teams to gain up to 20 points for the highest hang. An elevation measurement stick determines the robot's elevation tier. Some teams won't have the mechanics needed to hang, giving the teams that do an advantage. 

### Middle Barrier
A barrier separates the field into two sides at the center. At any time, each team is allowed to traverse over the Middle Barrier to get to the other side. 

The Middle Barrier is 91.88" in length and 2.38" in diameter. The barrier is raised 0.50" off the ground and 2.88" at its highest point. 
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/9.png) 

During the match, if 2 robots from the same alliance are on the same side of the Middle Barrier it is considered Double-Zoning. If Double-Zoning occurs, the opposing alliance can de-score from the opposite alliance's Goal. 

### Triballs
The field is set up with 12 neutral Triballs that are placed in the same position at the beginning of each match. During the match, each alliance has 22 neutral Triballs that can be matchloaded into the Match Load Zones or gently matchloaded onto their robot that is contacting the Match Load Zone. The Triballs can be found in the green neutral color, or  red or blue designating each alliance. 

The Triballs are a slightly rounded triangular pyramidal shape, also known as a Reuleaux Triangle. Each Triball is 6.18" tall and weighs approximately 110 grams. 
![unnamed](https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/23-24/vrc-overunder/online-manual/image/6.png) 

Robots can move Triballs into their alliance's Goal or offensive zone to score points during the match. Each robot can only possess one Triball at a time.

# Dated Entries

# **4/29/23 - VRC Game Reveal 2023**
*This entry was not a formal practice.*

- [x] Elliott

On the last day of worlds, the 2023-2024 VRC Competition was revealed. Elliott attended worlds with his former team. After the game reveal, Elliott started to brainstorm potential mechanisms for Over-Under. He came across a FRC game similar to OU called Charge-Up. He found FRC team 2910's robot that completed the same function of picking up Reuleaux polygons similar to OU Triballs. The video he saw of the robot is listed below.
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE]()

FRC team 2910's robot had a standard tank drivetrain with an arm, as well as an intake that uses rubber rollers similar to VRC Flex Wheels. The function of the arm and intake was meant to grab the scoring objects off the ground and extend the arm out to place them on a platform. This is very similar to how the VEX Over-Under game is played. 

## **Entry Recap**
Elliott started brainstorming ideas for Over-Under mechanisms.

# 4/30/23 - Initial Design

## **Attendance**
- [x] Elliott

After analyzing FRC team 2910's robot Elliott started 3D Modeling a bot modified for the Over-Under competition. This design included a 6-motor drivetrain with a gear ratio of 36:60, a catapult that included a slip gear mechanism made from high-strength axles and rubber bands, and an intake utilizing chain drives and flex wheels in order to grip onto the triballs.

# 5/1/23 - Triball Transport

## **Attendance**
- [x] Elliott

Elliott researched a way to transport and hold the triballs; he found a claw that uses a chain and sprocket mechanism that connected to shafts with flex wheels on them to be able to intake the triballs faster as well as have a better grip so the robot can hold the triballs more effectively when at high speeds or taking sharp turns that when using a standard claw would cause the triball to fling escape the control of the robot.

# 5/2/23 - Claw Mech

## **Attendance**
- [x] Elliott

Elliott tried to figure out different positions and places to place the claw on the robot and allow it to adjust its height but still have it be stable; eventually, he decided to add it to the front of the robot using two support beams made up of 25x2x1 C channels attached on two more supports made up of 18x2x1 C channels. It was motorized via a gear mechanism with a gear ratio 1:7 using a 12T gear and 84T gear.

# 5/4/23 - Drive Train Design

## **Attendance**
- [x] Elliott

Elliott started adding a new drive train, which included lifted wheels to the old drive train, which was unable to traverse the middle bar, so the added height allowed the robot to access the other side of the field without having to go through the neutral zone, saving time during the match.

# 5/8/23 - Catapult Design

## **Attendance**
- [x] Elliott

Elliott modeled the catapult more and some arm bracing for the catapult for support.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Elliott

Elliott started designing a new drive train, including a 6-motor, quad 4-inch omni wheel setup, and two flex wheels located in the middle of the omni wheels setup for easier gripping and traversing the middle bar efficiently. It has a gear ratio. Of 36:72, it totaled 300rpm.

After testing the new flywheel, Elliott decided it was too big and lost too much momentum after every tribal was placed and determined to opt out of using a flywheel and detach it from the robot. He reattached the wings and boxed them so they wouldn't bend when hitting other robots, the nets, or when pushing triballs.

After the disappointing performance of the catapult at the J.L Mann competition, we decided to remove it and switch to a slip gear kicker. We also decided to add guides using laser-cut polycarbonate for the intake and the wheels to get over the middle bar. We utilized our robot's center of gravity by bringing it over the bar before the wheels make contact, generating a smoother, more efficient crossover.

Today, our Goal is to work on our robot's polycarbonate guides and guards. Elliott finished cutting out the revised polycarbonate wing guards and the wedge that will go on the front of our robot.
The scoop had to be bent because Elliott's idea for the plow was for it to do three things.

The wedge had to be bent because Elliott's idea for the plow was for it to do three things
+ Act as a guard for the robot
+ Act as a plow for the triballs to get over the middle bar easier
+ Act as a defensive wedge to temporarily prop up other people's robots so they become immobile for a couple of seconds without getting DQed for entanglement

Delrin has interesting thermal properties; it doesn't have a set melting temperature because it's a plastic. Instead, it has a Vicat Softening point at around 145-150 degrees Celsius (293-302 Fahrenheit). Because we want to bend the Delrin, we must be careful to reach exactly 130 degrees Celsius (266 Fahrenheit) and not go over because this could cause it to warp and bend in undesirable ways. Elliott accomplished this by using a heat gun, vices, and wooden blocks to hold it in the desirable position.

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Finish "5 Ball Rush Auton"
- [ ] Test "Close Side Win Point Auton"
- [x] Design, Test and Finish Hang


The "5 Ball Rush Auton" aims to take control of the 2 triballs easily captured by either team this early on. 

Usually we CAD our design before we think about building it, but we chose to take the trial and error approach for our hanging mech. Inventor is difficult to use with joints, and our hang bar is based strongly on our joints. Any model we would make would be inaccurate, difficult to add, and a waste of time. It would be much easier for us to start with something and adjust it as we go.

## **Entry Recap**
We were able to build and test a functional hang mechanism that we will further stress test at the Clemson comp.
